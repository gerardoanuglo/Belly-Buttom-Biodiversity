# BIODIVERSITY IN A BELLY BUTTON - A INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD

On average our hands carry 3,200 different microbes a day. We are told our whole lives to clean our hands and wash our bodies to get rid of any dirt and microbes we collect throughout the day. We fixate on keeping our hands and face clean because they are high traffic areas for microbes to gather on. Yet have you ever wondered what kind of microbes are found in your belly button?  A place often forgotten and infrequently cleaned. The belly button often collects sweat, dead skin and bacteria in the folds of the skin. It’s a habitat closest to us and relatively unexplored.
 
Up until now you probably haven’t thought about it. Don’t worry the idea has now set in your subconscious and soon you’ll be clamoring to find out. Like I said don’t worry, I got you covered. I created an interactive dashboard that identified the microbes found in the belly button and identified potential factors influencing the biodiversity of the region. 

Using the Belly Button Diversity Dataset, I gathered data from 640 participants to visualize in the dashboard. I also identified the most common microbes found and the average factors among participants, such as washing frequency and type of belly button.
