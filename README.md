# BIODIVERSITY IN A BELLY BUTTON - A INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD

Every human who has ever lived has had a belly button, yet how often do we forget about this body part and neglect it in our personal hygienic routine. While it's a small part of the body, it needs to be cleaned often. 

Since the belly button gets often forgotten, I decided to identify what kind of microbes live in this region of the human body. 

Using data from the Belly Button Diversity Dataset, I built a interactive dashboard to explore the biodiversity in the navel of 1000 participants.
