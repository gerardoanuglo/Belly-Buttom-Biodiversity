# BIODIVERSITY IN A BELLY BUTTON - A INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD

Every human who has ever lived has had a belly button, yet how often do we forget about this body part and neglect it in our personal hygienic routine. While it's a small part of the body, it needs to be cleaned often. Since the belly button gets often forgotten, I decided to identify what kind of microbes live in this region of the human body 
in hopes to permote frequent cleaning of the belly button.
to partice my ability of creating a clear and concise interactive dashboard. 

Using data from the Belly Button Diversity Dataset, I built a interactive dashboard to explore the biodiversity in the belly button of 1000 participants. This  dashboard allows you to choose a individual by their subject id and populates each visualization with that persons unique results. 

This page is a quick overview of my project. If you want to know more about the technical side of how I created this interactive dashboard, you can check out the explainer file in this github repository.

## A Closer Look

### The Demographic TABLE
This table shows demographic information about the individual such as age, gender, location.

bbtype indicates

wfreq indicates how often a person cleans their belly button per week.

### The Bar Graph

This visualization indicates the top ten baceteria found in the individual's belly button.

### The Bubble Chart

This visualization showcases the relative abudance of each microbial species (techniqually operational taxonomic units, OTU ID) in the belly button. The area of each circle is proportional to the value (here, the amount of times a species was found in the belly button.

### Conclusion
I could improve this dashboard by adding a gauge that visualizes the frequency a person washes their belly button, using a range from 0-9. 9 being the highest number indicated by a individual.
